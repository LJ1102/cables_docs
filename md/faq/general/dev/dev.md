# What is dev.cables.gl

The most recent release of cables will always be on [cables.gl](https://cables.gl) and you can check the features and fixes in that release in our [changelog](https://cables.gl/changelog).

While we are working on a new release we constantly push changes to [dev.cables.gl](https://dev.cables.gl), sometimes a few times a day.

This gives you the ability to work with the latest, hottest features in cables and test your patches before the next release. 
While we keep a solid eye on backwards-compatibility, feel free to report any breaking changes through [discussions](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_docs/discussions).

The version on `dev.cables.gl` might be buggy, not polished yet and the server might be down at certain times. 
Do not rely on new features being exactly as they are on the development version before release...things might change.

We try to have everything on `dev.cables.gl` in the next release. 
There is no guarantee on that though, as some things might need more time, work, love and testing and others might be removed again entirely as we decided otherwise. Do not count on things on `dev.cables.gl`!

Log in to [dev.cables.gl](https://dev.cables.gl) using your cables credentials. All your patches will be in the same state. 
You can find ops that are currently developed in the [`Ops.Dev`](https://dev.cables.gl/ops/Ops.Dev)-Namespace for you to test, explore and take a sneak-peek. If you use any of these in your patches, you will not be able to open these patches on "live" anymore...usually until the next release.

Doing things this way gives us the possiblity to ask for feedback on new features, find bugs that we didn't think of early and also test new features with bigger patches and a bigger audience.
